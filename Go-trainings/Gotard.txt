dynamic size go routine
threads are of fixed size
go routine stack size is not fixed(kb-mb)
woks faster
when 1 OS thread created , go routine stack moves to thar OS thread .
go routines communicate using channels
for race condition:
If there is many goroutines to excute and access 1 resource
they put to gochannels
if 1 gochannel excuted it stored into queue by using buffer channel
